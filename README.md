# Running locally

1. setup: [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): (`nvm use`)
2. install dependencies: `npm install`
3. run local server: `s/server` to run a local server
4. WebMIDI requires https, so you'll need to trust the self-signed certificate, (one provided:
   localhost.crt/localhost.key)

Sorry for the messy code, it was made in a day.
